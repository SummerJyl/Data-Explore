## Case Study: Resolving Module Import Errors Caused by Folder Naming and Path Issues in a React TypeScript Project

Background:
During the development of a Bio Health Data Explorer React project, I encountered persistent

## TypeScript errors

Cannot find module '../api/usdaApi' or its corresponding type declarations.
Cannot find module '../components/NutrientChart' or its corresponding type declarations.
These errors appeared in the main Home.tsx component file, despite the referenced files existing in the correct folder structure under the src directory.

## Root Cause Analysis

Folder Naming with Spaces:
The project root directory contained a space in its name (Bio Health/Data Explorer). While operating systems like macOS and Windows handle folder names with spaces without issue, this can cause problems in some developer tools or terminal commands if paths are not properly escaped.

## Incorrect Relative Import Paths

The import statements in Home.tsx used relative paths that incorrectly traversed the folder hierarchy:

import { fetchFoodData, fetchFoodDetails } from '../api/usdaApi';
import NutrientChart from '../components/NutrientChart';
Since Home.tsx resides inside src, and api and components are sibling folders within src, using ../ was causing the compiler to look one directory level above src, where the modules do not exist.

## Effect of Spaces in Folder Names on Imports

Although the space in Data Explorer folder does not directly affect imports inside src (since import paths are relative to src), the tooling or terminal might mishandle commands when spaces are not escaped properly, leading to indirect confusion or build failures.

## The Fix

Corrected Import Paths:

The import statements were updated to correctly reference files relative to src:

import { fetchFoodData, fetchFoodDetails } from './api/usdaApi';
import NutrientChart from './components/NutrientChart';
This ensured that the TypeScript compiler and bundler resolved the modules correctly within the project structure.

## Project Folder Naming Best Practice

While spaces in folder names can be supported, I chose to rename the root project folder to eliminate spaces (e.g., BioHealth_DataExplorer or BioHealth-DataExplorer).

This eliminated any risk of shell command or tooling errors related to unescaped spaces in paths, improving overall stability and developer experience.

## Lessons Learned / Talking Points

Relative imports must be precise: Always verify your relative paths from the importing fileâ€™s location to the target module, avoiding unnecessary ../ that moves outside your working directory.

Avoid spaces in folder/file names in code projects: Spaces can cause subtle bugs or tooling issues. Using dashes or underscores ensures compatibility across platforms and tools.

Check build tool configs: Ensure your build tool (e.g., Vite, Webpack) is correctly set up to resolve your paths as expected.

Use IDE and terminal carefully: Sometimes errors stem from how your shell or editor handles paths, especially with spaces. Know how to escape paths or rename folders accordingly.
