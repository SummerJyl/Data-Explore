# TODO / Roadmap for Data Explorer

## Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Create initial layout component (`Home.tsx`)
- [ ] Design wireframe or sketch for UI layout
- [ ] Add mock data structure (static JSON or TypeScript interfaces)
- [ ] Integrate Tailwind CSS styles for basic layout and responsiveness

## Data Integration
- [ ] Research and select bio health datasets (e.g., public health stats, genomic data, supplement ingredients)
- [ ] Set up API structure or mock API for data fetching
- [ ] Create data models/types for TypeScript
- [ ] Implement data fetching with error/loading states

## Features & Enhancements
- [ ] Display dataset in clean, user-friendly tables or cards
- [ ] Add filtering, sorting, and search functionality
- [ ] Add data visualization (charts, graphs) for key metrics
- [ ] Implement user interaction flows (e.g., detailed view, data export)

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for components
- [ ] Write integration tests for data fetching and rendering
- [ ] Set up testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library)

## Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Expand README.md with usage instructions and setup
- [ ] Document components and data flow
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md if collaborative
- [ ] Regularly update GitHub Project board and backlog items

## 1. Advanced Search & Filters
Filter food data by nutrient categories (protein, fat, vitamins, etc.)

Search by multiple criteria (e.g., low sugar, gluten-free)

## 2. Data Visualization
Charts showing nutrient breakdowns for selected foods (bar charts, pie charts)

Trend graphs for historical or clinical data

## 3. User Profiles & Saved Searches
Allow users to save favorite foods or queries

Profile settings with health goals or dietary preferences

## 4. Interactive Dashboards
Summary cards with key bio-health metrics

Integration of external APIs (e.g., clinical trials, FDA databases)

## 5. Responsive & Accessible UI
Mobile-friendly layout with smooth navigation

ARIA roles and keyboard navigation for accessibility

## 1: Advanced Search & Filters
Phase 1: Basic Search + Filter UI
Keep your existing search input

Add filter options (checkboxes or dropdowns) for nutrient categories, e.g.:

Protein

Fat

Carbs

Vitamins

Minerals

Phase 2: Filter Logic in Code
Update your search handler to include filter criteria

Adjust API call or data filtering in frontend based on selected filters

Phase 3: UX Enhancements
Show active filters as tags/chips with “clear” buttons

Add loading states and empty results messaging
## UX-friendly approach for your filters:
Use a single dropdown or “Filter” button that opens a compact filter panel or menu

Filters toggle on/off with just one tap

Keep all controls reachable without scrolling on mobile

Show active filters clearly and let users clear all with one click

Minimize clutter with progressive disclosure (show only what’s needed)
